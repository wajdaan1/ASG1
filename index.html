<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>

  <p><strong>HTML</strong> is the Web√≠s core language for creating content for everyone to use anywhere. The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. </p>
  <p>HTML was originally designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, but its general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents.</p>

<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>

  <p><strong>Style Sheets</strong> describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet mechanism that has been specifically developed to meet the needs of Web designers and users.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

  <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
    control over them.</p>

  <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
    such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
